#Install Apache-Tomcat7#

I am going to work with the core installer, in the core sub section click the item tar.gz. Once after done this, you will be able to download the apache-tomcat-7.0.61.tar.gz file.

URL : https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi

wget http://apache.spinellicreations.com/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.61/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.61.tar.gz

I just downloaded the apache-tomcat-7.0.61.tar.gz file.

#Creating the installation directory

I have created and work follow path directory whiteroom/apache/tomcat

In the terminal to create the path directory suggested above, be sure to be located in your home user directory, I mean, /home/username.

[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 ~]$ pwd
/home/bpeddada
[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 ~]$ 

My username is bpeddada.Now create the path directory by execute the command mkdir -p whiteroom/apache/tomcat.

[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 ~]$ mkdir -p whiteroom/apache/tomcat
[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 ~]$ 

Creating the path directory whiteroom/apache/tomcat

#Copying the installer to our customized installation directory

Now copy or move the Tomcat installer (apache-tomcat-7.0.61.tar.gz) to the path directory whiteroom/apache/tomcat.

#Now go to the path directory whiteroom/apache/tomcat 

By execute the command cd whiteroom/apache/tomcat

[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 ~]$ cd whiteroom/apache/tomcat
[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 tomcat]$ ls 
apache-tomcat-7.0.61.tar.gz

#Unpacking the .tar.gz file

Now time to work with apache-tomcat-7.0.61.tar.gz file, we only need to unpack it by executing the command tar -zxvf apache-tomcat-7.0.61.tar.gz

[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 tomcat]$ tar -zxvf apache-tomcat-7.0.61.tar.gz
[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 tomcat]$ ls 
apache-tomcat-7.0.61  apache-tomcat-7.0.61.tar.gz

After the execution of the command a new directory called apache-tomcat-7.0.61 must appear,

#Going to the apache-tomcat-7.0.61/bin directory

Execute the command cd apache-tomcat-7.0.61/bin

[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 tomcat]$ cd apache-tomcat-7.0.61/bin/
[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 bin]$

See what files in the apache-tomcat-7.0.61/bin directory

[bpeddada@LLT440-00030 bin]$ ls 
bootstrap.jar                 daemon.sh         startup.sh
catalina.bat                  digest.bat        tomcat-juli.jar
